# NowPlaying
The #NowPlaying page is a simple one-page app where visitors can visualize the most recent videos being shared on Twitter by people nearby.

## Features

This proyect was developed with 
- AngularJS v1.7.0
- Express v4.16.3

AngularJs was used on this project because the project's complexity is not high. With this, I do not want to say AngularJs is not powerfull, indeed, it stil remains on top of best framework. In addition, its data binding was key to the HTML refresh.


I was thinking about using Flask Framework for this project as a server / apirest because of comfort and it is easier, but, for deploy is a better Nodejs and i found a plugin `Twit` to handle Twitter API REST.
